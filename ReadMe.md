## Overview

This week emphasizes real-world input/output data processing using CSV and JSON formats. It also introduces advanced Java concepts such as annotations and reflection, along with fundamental design principles to guide clean, modular software development.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: CSV Data Handling

- Reading from and writing to CSV files
- Parsing CSV using built-in Java I/O and external libraries (e.g., OpenCSV)
- Common pitfalls in CSV parsing
- Handling large datasets

### Day 2: JSON Data

- Introduction to JSON format
- Parsing JSON in Java using libraries like Jackson or Gson
- Converting Java objects to/from JSON
- Working with nested and complex JSON structures

### Day 3: Annotations, Reflection, and Designing Principles

- What are annotations? Built-in vs. custom annotations
- Using reflection to inspect and manipulate classes at runtime
- Practical use cases of reflection and annotations
- SOLID principles and clean code fundamentals
- Applying design principles in Java codebases

## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains code snippets, tools, and exercises. Use the examples to understand the underlying concepts, and then expand upon them by building your own parsers, converters, or utilities.
